# 99 Days of Problem Solving Challenge by [DIU CPC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/diu-cpc-computer-programming-club)

## Hello! 👋

I'm Fardin Kamal, a student of Computer Science and Engineering at Dhaka International University and member of the Computer Programming Club.

I'm participating in the 99 Days of Problem Solving Challenge where we will be solving problems from Codeforces and I'll share my solutions in this repository.


## Tools
**Language:** `Go`

**Reason:** I want to learn Go and I think this challenge will help me to learn it as well as Golang feels very easy & familiar unlike other statically typed, compiled languages.


## Progress
**Streak:** 26 day

**Start Date:** 1st November, 2024

**End Date:** 8th February, 2025
